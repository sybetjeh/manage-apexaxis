        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p><strong>What happened to our data?</strong></p>
        <p>All data stored on our servers prior to our transition to private and closed-source operations has been permanently deleted. We do not retain any backups of this data. It was the responsibility of our users to ensure that they had adequate backups of their data before the transition.</p>

        <p><strong>Is it still free if I reach out?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, we offer a freemium model. This means that while our core services are available at no cost, there may be premium features or options available for a fee. Please contact us to discuss your specific needs and to receive more information about our current offerings.</p>

        <p><strong>What could I host with your services?</strong></p>
        <p>Our platform officially supports hosting for Discord bots. However, you can also host other types of applications including Node.js, Java, and Python applications. Please note that we do not support reverse proxying to custom domains, except for the subdomain we provide.</p>

        <p><strong>What led to this change in operations?</strong></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, one of our critical servers experienced a severe drive failure that could not be recovered. In response to this, we determined it was best to transition to a private, closed-source model to better manage and protect our infrastructure moving forward.</p>
